/*
If there are duplicates, they cannot be nested inside each other (since condition requires A[i] < A[j]).
So the bottleneck is:
  The maximum frequency of any radius decides the minimum number of visible bottles.

Why?

Suppose we have k bottles of the same radius.

None of them can go inside each other.

Even if all other bottles are nested perfectly, youâ€™ll still see at least k bottles.
